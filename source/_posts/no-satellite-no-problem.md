Do you need to build an application that consumes data from satellites, or sends control commands to them, but you don't have an actual satellite or ground station, yet?

You have come to the right place! At [localgyros](https://localgyros.com) we build simulated satellite systems that provide an API for your application to use before you design and launch your satellite, or build or lease a ground station.
